/// \ingroup Memory
/// \brief A class that implements an allocation policy for memory arenas.
/// \details This class implements the concepts of an allocation policy as expected by the MemoryArena class.
///
/// The allocation scheme employed by this class is that of a general purpose allocator. Internally, the class uses
/// \c malloc and \c free provided by the C runtime. The implementation serves as a wrapper around \c malloc
/// and \c free which can be used in conjunction with the memory arena system. This enables users to use Potato
/// memory facilities like memory tracking and bounds checking with the platform's built-in allocator. Furthermore,
/// the allocator respects all alignment requirements, which is not supported by ordinary \c malloc.
/// \remark Statistics gathering can be enabled/disabled via the preprocessor option \ref X_ENABLE_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR_STATISTICS.
/// If statistics are disabled, the allocator will still return a valid MemoryAllocatorStatistics object which is
/// initialized to its default values.
/// \remark Because the inner workings of \c malloc and \c free are highly platform-dependent (and often undocumented),
/// memory statistics will not be as accurate compared to custom-built allocators.
