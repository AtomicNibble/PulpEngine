/// \ingroup Memory
/// \brief A class that implements an allocation policy for memory arenas.
/// \details This class implements the concepts of an allocation policy as expected by the MemoryArena class.
///
/// The allocation scheme employed by this class is that of a non-growing linear allocator. Allocation requests are
/// satisfied by returning individual regions of memory carved out of a pre-allocated block of memory. This block of
/// memory is supplied by the user, and thus supports both heap-based as well as stack-based allocations.
///
/// The following example illustrates both kinds of allocation:
/// \code
///   // 4096 bytes of memory on the stack
///   char memory[4096] = {};
///
///   // the linear allocator uses this stack memory to satisfy all allocation requests
///   core::LinearAllocator allocator(memory, memory+4096);
///
///   // allocate 64 KB on the heap
///   core::HeapArea heapArea(65536);
///
///   // let the linear allocator use this 64 KB of memory on the heap
///   core::LinearAllocator allocator(heapArea.GetStart(), heapArea.GetEnd());
/// \endcode
/// Allocating memory using the linear allocator is \b extremely fast, because the allocator only needs to offset a pointer
/// internally whenever an allocation is made. However, one disadvantage of a linear allocation scheme is that individual
/// allocations cannot be freed. Instead, all allocations must be freed at once.
///
/// Common usage scenarios for a linear allocator include temporary per-frame allocations (such as for e.g. building a
/// command-buffer for the GPU), or allocations that have application-lifetime.
