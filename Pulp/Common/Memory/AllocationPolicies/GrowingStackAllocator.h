/// \ingroup Memory
/// \brief A class that implements an allocation policy for memory arenas.
/// \details This class implements the concepts of an allocation policy as expected by the MemoryArena class.
///
/// The allocation scheme employed by this class is that of a growing stack allocator. The allocator behaves similar
/// to the non-growing StackAllocator, but is not restricted to working within a fixed region of memory. This allocator
/// will initially only reserve virtual address space without allocating any physical memory. As the allocator needs to
/// grow, more and more physical memory is allocated, up to a given maximum size. Whenever an allocations is freed, the
/// allocator doesn't return physical memory to the OS. This ensures that the allocator doesn't suffer from performance
/// penalties whenever some allocations/deallocations straddle a page boundary. Instead, physical memory which is no longer
/// needed must be explicitly released by calling Purge().
///
/// Growing is implemented by making use of the virtual memory system. At first, the given amount of virtual address
/// space is reserved without allocating any physical memory. Whenever an allocation no longer fits into the currently
/// allocated physical memory, additional memory will be requested from the OS. The granularity with which the allocator
/// grows is provided by the user, and the implementation automatically handles allocations that are larger than the
/// grow size.
///
/// \remark Statistics gathering can be enabled/disabled via the preprocessor option \ref X_ENABLE_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR_STATISTICS.
/// If statistics are disabled, the allocator will still return a valid MemoryAllocatorStatistics object which is
/// initialized to its default values.
/// \remark Checking for wrong usage of the stack allocator can be enabled/disabled via the preprocessor option
/// \ref X_ENABLE_STACK_ALLOCATOR_CHECK. Enabling the check causes a small memory overhead and performance hit for
/// each allocation, and should therefore be disabled in retail builds.
