//! \brief Base class for user defined GPU deformer override evaluators 
/*!
 MPxGPUDeformer lets you create user-defined GPU deformer
 overrides.  A GPU deformer override replaces the CPU implementation of
 a deformer node when the evaluation manager is enabled and the deformerEvaluator
 plug-in is enabled.  Use MPxGPUDeformer to override the deformation for a
 Maya deformer or for a plug-in deformer implemented through
 MPxDeformerNode.  MPxGPUDeformer
 must register which node type it overrides using MGPUDeformerRegistry.

 MPxGPUDeformer defines a deformer node as a node which has input
 geometry and output geometry.  MPxGPUDeformer assumes that the
 number of vertices in the input and output geometry of a deformer node are the
 same.  This definition includes nodes which are traditionally thought of as
 deformer nodes, such as skinCluster or blendShape, but also includes nodes like
 groupParts, which may be part of deformation chains.

 To ensure optimal performance when you implement MPxGPUDeformer,
 keep the following in mind:
  - Calls to the ctor must be fast.  Do not do heavy work
    in the ctor because the deformer evaluator may allocate GPU deformers
	which are never used.  Save heavy work for the evaluate() method.
  - Cache needed values on the graphics card during evaluate().  Use
    the MEvaluationNode interface to determine if input values are constant or
	change over time.

 If you use this interface, you must implement the virtual method
 evaluate() for MPxGPUDeformer to function.  See the evaluate()
 documentation for additional requirements on the evaluate() method.  The
 terminate() method is optional.

 <b>About the deformer evaluator:</b>

 The deformer evaluator identifies chains of supported nodes terminated by a
 mesh.  The deformer evaluator then replaces CPU evaluation
 of these nodes with GPGPU kernels.  The final deformed geometry is directly
 shared with Viewport 2.0, which avoids any GPU read back.  When you implement
 an MPxGPUDeformer for a given node type, you expand the
 list of deformer evaluator supported nodes, which then allows more deformer
 chains to execute on the GPU.

 A deformer chain is created by identifying an animated display mesh and then
 following then geometry connections upstream until a source plug, that
 meets any one of the following criteria, is reached:
 \li On an unsupported node.
 \li On a node which does not depend on time.
 \li Contains fan out connections.

 When one of the preceding conditions is true for a source plug, that source plug
 is considered the <i>input</i> to the deformation chain, and the corresponding
 source plug node is not evaluated in the deformer evaluator.

 Example Chains:
 \li HistoryNode: any node (supported or unsupported) which does not depend on time.
 \li origMesh: the original mesh shape: the ultimate source of the deformation chain.
 \li SupportedNode: a node that the deformer evaluator explicitly supports that also depends on time
 \li UnsupportedNode: any node that the deformer evaluator does not support that also depends on time

 <b>Example 1:</b> \li HistoryNode1 -> origMesh -> HistoryNode2 -> SupportedNode1 -> SupportedNode1 -> displayMesh

  The first time that the deformer evaluator runs on example 1, the HistoryNode2 geometry output is copied to the GPU.  SupportedNode1 and
  SupportedNode2 then run kernels to perform the deformations, and the final deformed result is then shared with VP2.
  Subsequent evaluations re-use the copy of HistoryNode2 output geometry
  already on the GPU, which avoids expensive data transfer.

 <b>Example 2:</b> \li HistoryNode1 -> origMesh -> HistoryNode2 -> UnsupportedNode1 -> SupportedNode1 -> displayMesh

  In this scenario, UnsupportedNode1 runs on the CPU and generates an 
  intermediate result.  This intermediate result is copied to the GPU.  Once copied,
  SupportedNode1 runs its kernel and displayMesh shares data with VP2.

 <b>Example 3:</b> \li HistoryNode1-> origMesh -> HistoryNode2 -> SupportedNode1 -> UnsupportedNode1 -> displayMesh

  In this scenario, the deformer evaluator does nothing.  If we performed
  SupportedNode1's deformation on the GPU, we would need to read back
  that data and use it as an input for UnsupportedNode1 on the CPU.  Read back
  is not supported by the deformer evaluator.

 <b>Example 4:</b> \li origMesh1 -> SupportedNode1.outMesh[0] -> displayMesh1
				   \li origMesh2 -> SupportedNode1.outMesh[1] -> displayMesh2

  In this scenario, the deformer evaluator creates two chains, one for displayMesh1
  and a second for displayMesh2.  These chains both run on the GPU.
  Note that if SupportedNode1 is derived from MPxDeformerNode, then there can be
  zero relationship between the mesh data used in displayMesh1 and displayMesh2.
  displayMesh1 could have 100 vertices, and displayMesh2 could have one million
  vertices.

 <b>Example 5:</b> \li origMesh1 -> SupportedNode1.outMesh[0] -> displayMesh1
				   \li origMesh2 -> SupportedNode1.outMesh[1] -> UnsupportedNode1 ->displayMesh2

  In this scenario, the deformer evaluator does nothing.  We do support the first
  chain for displayMesh1, but we do not support the chain for displayMesh2.  The deformer
  evaluator does not support the partial override of a node.  In this case, SupportedNode1
  has only partial support because the deformer evaluator can override evaluation for
  outMesh[0] but not for outMesh[1].  This prevents deformer evaluator from doing
  any GPU work in this scenario.

 The deformer evaluator allocates a unique MPxGPUDeformer object for each
 supported node in each supported chain.  In Example 4, two MPxGPUDeformer
 objects are allocated for SupportedNode1, one for multi-element 0 and a second
 for multi-element 1.

 The deformer evaluator's emphasis on avoiding geometry read back from the GPU
 means that unsupported nodes that follow a deformation chain exclude that
 chain from GPU evaluation.
