//! \ingroup OpenMaya
//! \brief Register callbacks that are based on a fixed time interval. 
/*!

  This class is used to register callbacks that are called at fixed
  time intervals.

  To remove a callback use MMessage::removeCallback.

  All callbacks that are registered by a plug-in must be removed by
  that plug-in when it is unloaded.  Failure to do so will result in
  a fatal error.
