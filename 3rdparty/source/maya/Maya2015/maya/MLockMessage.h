// CLASS DESCRIPTION (MLockMessage)
//
//	This class is used to register callbacks for conditional node and
//	plug locking. These callbacks allow you to intercept events that
//	involve the internal testing of the lock flag on a node or
//	plug. If the node, or plug, is locked the assigned API callback
//	routine, if attached to the node, will be invoked, and, at this
//	time, you have the option to override the lock. This allows the
//	API programmer the ability to ignore a lock and allow a lock event
//	to occur. This allows the API programmer to adjust the level of
//	granularity on the locking mechanism. There are three levels of
//	locking callbacks.
//
//
//		\li <b>DAG Level Events</b>
//		\li <b>All Other Node Level Events</b>
//      \li <b>Plug Level Events</b>
//
//
// To remove a callback use MMessage::removeCallback.  All callbacks
// that are registered by a plug-in must be removed by that plug-in
// when it is unloaded. Failure to do so will result in a fatal error.

// CLASS DECLARATION (MLockMessage)

//! \ingroup OpenMaya
//! \brief Node and plug locking messages. 
/*!
    Plug locking was implemented with Maya 1.0. Individual plugs can
    be locked so that their values cannot be changed. The locking
    state is held within the plug. The plug's locked state can be
    changed via the API with the method MPlug::setLocked(bool), or, in
    MEL, using the command "setAttr -l {on,off}".

    The ability to lock nodes was added with Maya 4.5. Node locking
    prevents renaming, reparenting, deletion, and other node-related
    changes. It also restricts the ability to change the state of any
    plug locks. The intent is that the user relies upon plug locking
    first, to lock the desired plugs they don't want to change, and
    then uses node locking to lock the node itself. Node locking can
    be set via MEL command, "lockNode", or via
    MFnDependencyNode::setLocked(bool)

	MLockMessage class allows the API user to register callbacks that
	control how Maya handles locks. The registered callbacks are
	invoked whenever a query to the lock state is involved. Therefore,
	the callback would be called even if the node was not locked.

    When a callback is invoked, the API user will be given a decision
    variable where they can place their decision. This decision
    variable is a boolean, and the boolean can take on the following
    values:


    \li <b>true</b> - accept the default behavior. When the node/plug is
    locked the default behavior is to obey the lock. When the node/plug is
    unlocked the default behavior is to do the action/edit.
    \li <b>false</b> - deny the default behavior. When the node/plug is
    locked the default behavior is to deny/override the lock; thus
    allowing the edit/action to occur. When the node/plug is unlocked the
    default behavior is make the node/plug locked - without physically
    setting the lock bit.

	<b>Caveats</b>

	You must use caution when using these routines.  The flow of execution
	is interrupted when these callbacks are invoked. Therefore, you should
	make your decision in a timely maanner or a serious performance penalty
	will result. Also, you should NEVER try to alter the DG state while
	executing within callback.  This includes quering/assigning a plug's
	value.  You may, however, examine state information like the lock
	state of the plug/node.
