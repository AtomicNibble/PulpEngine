/*!
  
This class is used to represent information about edits to parenting.
Such edits occur when a file is referenced and changes are made to the
dag hierarchy of nodes within that reference. When a reference is
unloaded, only the name of the nodes involved may be queried successfully.
When the referenced file is loaded, the nodes themselves may also be queried.

The MItEdits class may be used to iterate over all the edits on a given
reference or assembly.
