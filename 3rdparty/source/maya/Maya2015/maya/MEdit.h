//! \brief Base class for representing information about edits 
/*!
  
MEdit serves as the base class for representing information about edits that
are made to certain types of entities, specifically references and assemblies.
An edit is any operation that modifies a member of the entity.  Examples of
such modifications include changing attribute values, connections, parenting
and so on.

In the case of references, edits are the changes that occur to referenced nodes. 

In the case of assemblies, edits are the changes that occur to assembly members.

Derived classes implement specific types of edits, allowing them to be queried depending on the type of operation.
