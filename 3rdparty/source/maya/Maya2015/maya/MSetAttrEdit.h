//! \brief Class for describing setAttr edits.
/*!
  
This class is used to return information about setAttr edits. Such edits
occur when a file is referenced and changes are made to attributes within
the file reference. When a reference is unloaded, only the plug name may 
be queried successfully. When the referenced file is loaded, the plug itself
may also be queried.

The MItEdits class may be used to iterate over all the edits on a given
reference or assembly.
