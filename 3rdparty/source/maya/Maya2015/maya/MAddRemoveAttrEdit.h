//! \brief Class for describing edits involving attributes which are added or removed.
/*!
  
This class is used to represent information about edits involving
attributes which are added or removed. Such edits occur when
attributes are added or removed from nodes in a referenced file. When
a reference is unloaded, only the node and attribute name may be queried
successfully. When the referenced file is loaded, the node itself may
also be queried.

The MItEdits class may be used to iterate over all the edits on a given
reference or assembly.
