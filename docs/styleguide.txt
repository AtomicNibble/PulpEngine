==== Engine Style Guide v0.1 ====

Intro:

This document is for me to write down how I'm currently 'doing things' in regards to style.
My personal style guide changes all the time but I always try to be consistent within a project.

Updating Code:

Any code that does not follow this style guide, should be updated.

Goals:

1. Consistent
2. Help reduce bugs
3. Readability

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source Naming:

    Header, inline and source files should have the same name.
    Improves readability

Header File Guards:

    Every header file should contain a #pragma once and a #ifndef guard.

Forward declarations:

    Forward declarations of types is allowed, to aid in reduced compile times.

Inline Functions:

    Use common sense when deciding if a function should be inlined or not.

    Inline functions should not be in the header file but a .inl file.
    Helps to reduce clutter in the header file, making the definition more easy to read.

Namespaces:

    All namespsaces must be declared using the X_NAMESPACE_BEGIN macro, so that they are children of the global engine namespace.

Unnamed Namespaces:

    Unmaned namespaces are encouraged.
    Any function that is not a member and declared + defined in a source file should be placed in a unnamed namespace.

Classes

    Constructors:

        No heavy work should be performed in constructors.

    Layout:

        try to place methods above all fields.
        Avoid mixing and matching.

    Interfaces:

        Wrap interfaces overrides with commets of the interface name before and after.

        Example:

                // IInterface
                virtual void foo() X_OVERIDE;
                // ~IInterface

    Single argument constructors:

        constructors taking a single argument should be declared explicit.

    Delegating constructors: (c++11)

        delegating construcors are allowed.

    Copy / Move:

        Support copy + move if it makes sense for the type.
        If not disable the copy + move operators.

        Using the = default AND = disabled are allowed.

    Virtual functions:

        all virtual functions must have either X_ABSTRACT, X_OVERRIDE OR X_FINAL.
        classes that inherit interfaces must have a X_OVERRIDE on the deconstructor.
        Helps catch interfaces without virtual constructors.

    Member variable naming:

        none-static:
                None static members variables should all have trailing underscores.

        static:
                All static members should have a leading s_ prefix including a trailing underscore.

        Pointers:

            Any pointer types static, or none static members should be prefixed with a lower case p.
            Type prefixing is not required for any other type.

    Templated members:

            Add typedefs for templated members.
            Eg: typedef core::Array<MyType> MyTypeArr;


Struct vs Classes:

    Use structs for 'data' structs are allowed to have members and constructors.
    Anything compelex / exposing logic should be a class.

Interfaces:

    All interfaces must have captial I prefix in name.

Exceptions:

    Eexceptions are disabled.

Run-time Type Information (RTTI)

    RTTI is disable, so use of dynamic_cast<T> is not allowed.

Casting:

    All casts should be c++ casts.
    All c casts should be replaced.

Const:

    Use const whenever it makes sense.

Null Pointers:

    favor nullptr over NULL.
    Using NULL in win32 api calls is about the only place it's allowed.

sizeof:

    Use sizeof(varName) not sizeof(Type) reduces chances of bugs when a variables type is changed.

Switches:

    Switches that do not need a deault should have a default case in debug mode with a asset.
    In release mode use the X_NO_SWITCH_DEFAULT

Unused paramaters:

    Used params are marked with X_UNUSED(paramName)

Pass by refrence:

    If passing by refrence allmost always should it be const.
    if a param is passed by none const ref place the word 'out' in the param name and have it last.

Enums:

    Enums should be declared using the following macros:
        X_DECLARE_ENUM          <- 32bit
        X_DECLARE_ENUM8        <- 8bit

        So that the additional functionality of ENUM_COUNT and to string is automatically added.

        Exceptions to the rule are enums that require specific numbering that is not 0-n

Flags:

    Flags should be declared used the following macros:
        X_DECLARE_FLAGS     <- 32ibt
        X_DECLARE_FLAGS8   <- 8bit

        Exceptions to the rule are flags that are more complete, having things like masks to allow
        for none power of 2 flags to be store in the flag.

        Flags should be define with the following style:

            X_DECLARE_FLAGS(MyFlag)(FLAG1, FLAG2);
            typedef Flags<MyFlag> MyFlags;

            So the flags define is singular only a typedef of Flags<T> is plural.

Data types that are written to file:

    Any structure or type that is written out to a file should have a X_ENSURE_SIZE macro.

    This macro checks the size of the type is the same in 32 and 64 bit builds and also will prevent compile
    when a data type that is written to file size is mistakleny changed.

Macros:

    When ever using #if, #ifndef etc allwyas place the condition in a comment after the #endif with a leading !

    Eg: #if X_EXAMPLE .... #endinf // !X_EXAMPLE


Format strings:

    Certain format strings should be prefixed.

    TYPE                                    Don't                               Do
    void * (or any pointer)             %lx                                 %p
    int64_t                                     %qd, %lld                      %" PRId64 "
    uint64_t                                   %qu, %llu, %llx              %" PRIu64 ", %" PRIx64 "
    size_t                                      %u                                  %" PRIuS ", %" PRIxS "
    ptrdiff_t                                   %d                                  %" PRIdS "
